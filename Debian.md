Debian, one of the oldest and most influential Linux distributions, has a rich history that began in August 1993 when Ian Murdock, then a student at Purdue University, announced the project. Here's a brief overview:

- **1993**: Ian Murdock started Debian with the goal of creating a distribution that would be developed openly, by a community, and would be free in the sense of freedom. The name "Debian" is a combination of his then-girlfriend Debra's name and his own. The first version, Debian 0.01, was released in September 1993.

- **1994-1996**: Debian grew rapidly with contributions from volunteers around the world. Version 1.1, codenamed 'Buzz', was released in June 1996. This version introduced the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG), which later influenced the Open Source Definition.

- **1996-2000**: Debian continued to evolve, with significant releases like 'Hamm' (2.0) in July 1998, which was the first to use the new package management system, dpkg, and 'Slink' (2.1) in March 1999, which introduced the concept of a stable release cycle.

- **2000-2005**: This period saw the release of 'Potato' (2.2) in August 2000, which was notable for being the first stable release to include cryptographic software due to changes in U.S. export laws. 'Woody' (3.0) followed in July 2002, introducing the testing and unstable branches more formally.

- **2005-2010**: 'Sarge' (3.1) was released in June 2005, bringing in a new installer and support for more architectures. 'Etch' (4.0) came out in April 2007, focusing on security and stability. 'Lenny' (5.0) was released in February 2009, introducing improvements in package management and system tools.

- **2010-Present**: Debian has continued to grow with releases like 'Squeeze' (6.0) in February 2011, 'Wheezy' (7.0) in May 2013, 'Jessie' (8) in April 2015, 'Stretch' (9) in June 2017, and 'Buster' (10) in July 2019. Each release brought advancements in security, software updates, and system performance. Debian 11, 'Bullseye', was released in August 2021, continuing the tradition of stability and community-driven development.

Debian's philosophy emphasizes the Debian Social Contract, which commits to free software, and the Debian Free Software Guidelines, ensuring that the software in Debian respects user freedom. Debian has served as a foundation for many other distributions, including Ubuntu, making it a cornerstone of the open-source ecosystem.
